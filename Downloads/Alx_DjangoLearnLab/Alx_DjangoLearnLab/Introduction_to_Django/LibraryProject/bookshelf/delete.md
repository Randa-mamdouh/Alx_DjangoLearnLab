# Delete Operation in Django Shell

## Purpose 
This document describes the process for deleting an instance of the 'book' model using the Django shell. In this example, we will delete the book titled **"1984"** and confirm the deletion by retrieving all 'Book' instances from database.

---
# import the Book model
from bookshelf.models import Book

# Retrieve the book to be deleted
book = Book.objects.get(title='1984')

book.delete()
# Expected output: (1, {'LibraryProjects.book': 1 }), indicating one 'Book' instance was deleted

# Confirm deletiong by retrieveing all books
all_books = Book.objects.all()
all_books # Expected Output: <Query Set[]> if no other books exist, or a list of remaining books
