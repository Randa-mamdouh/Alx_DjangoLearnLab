# Update Operation in Django shell

## Purpose 
This document descibes the process for updating an existing 'Book' instance in the Django shell. In this example, we will change the title of the titled **"1984"** to **"Nineteen Eighty-Four"** and save the changes.

---
from LibraryProject.models import Book

# Retrieve the book by title
book = Book.objects.get(title="1984")

# Update the title
book.title = "Nineteen Eighty-Four"
book.save() # Save the changes to the database

# Expected output: 'Nineteen Eighty-Four', confirming the title has been updated
book.title # Output: 'Nineteen Eighty-Four'
